		<p class="para3">Rehab for drug and alcohol addiction takes different forms. The type of treatment plan you receive
            should be personalized for you. This ensures the most effective care that can lead to lower relapse rates
            and higher chances of a successful recovery. After residential treatment, transitional living may be appropriate.
            This type of program provides additional options and benefits when inpatient treatment ends.</p>

            You don’t always have to live in an addiction treatment center for residential or inpatient rehab.
            Some clients receive outpatient or transitional care. They may either take part in transitional treatment
            after a residential rehab stay, or they may receive this type of treatment because their addiction issues
            are minor and very short-term. It can be a step down from a 24/7 rehab stay, with ongoing clinical services.
            Clients will attend therapy sessions anywhere from a few to several times per week. As their recovery progresses,
            they’ll attend fewer meetings. Furthermore, if you’re looking for a quality transitional living program Orange
            County CA offers, you have a variety of effective options.</P>

			<h2>BENEFITS AND DRAWBACKS OF TRANSITIONAL LIVING IN ADDICTION RECOVERY</h2>

				<p class="para3">
					Not everyone needs or can afford 24/7 rehab care. While residential treatment is usually best for
                    clients with long-term, severe addiction issues, some people haven’t used that long or have mild
                    dependency problems. Transitional living gives them the chance to overcome drug and alcohol addiction,
                    but it also allows them to continue fulfilling work or other obligations. For professionals with
                    demanding careers, this type of treatment may also be the only way they can get the help they need
                    because taking time away from their job isn’t possible. Furthermore, they return home to sleep at night,
                    where they’ll be in comfortable surroundings. If their home environment is toxic, however, they may
                    reside in a sober living home during treatment. Clients have more freedom in transitional treatment,
                    which is something they’ll have to adjust to after leaving the safe environment of residential rehab.
                    They must learn to manage triggers and stressors, not just in the short term but for the rest of
                    their lives. By easing into a post-rehab life in a transitional program, they can also do this gradually.</p>

		<h2>FINDING A TRANSITIONAL LIVING PROGRAM THAT SUITS YOU</h2>
		<p class="para3">
            Although clients have more freedom in transitional living, they must still participate in treatment to receive
            the benefits of it. This means showing up for all therapy sessions and completing any homework assignments
            counselors give them. Are you looking for the best transitional living program Orange County CA offers?
            Whether you’re a busy professional who needs treatment that fits into your life or you’re ready to step down
            from around-the-clock treatment, Pillars Recovery has quality options for you.</p>
