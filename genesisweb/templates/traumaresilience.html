        <h3><font color="#01A9DB">What is Trauma?</font></h3>
        <p class="pfound3">Psychological trauma is defined as a deeply disturbing experience that impacts a person’s physical
            or psychological safety and well-being to the degree that it impedes their ability to function in the world.
            It involves an overwhelming level of stress that exceeds one’s internal resources, and thus, one is unable to
            cope or integrate the intense emotions that emerge from that experience. Examples of acute trauma include physical
            and sexual assaults, experiences associated with military combat, accidents, certain medical procedures,
            natural disasters,
            and violent crime.  Developmental trauma can include child abuse (both physical and emotional), neglect,
            deprivation,
            unsafe living conditions, or repetitive bullying.  Developmental trauma can manifest in ongoing negative
            relational interactions
            occurring within families or among childhood peers.</p>

        <h3><font color="#01A9DB">What is Trauma-Informed Care?</font></h3>
        <p class="pfound3">At Genesis Sober we believe that the treatment of trauma is best conceptualized in stepwise
            fashion with three distinct phases.
            Phase one is symptom stabilization and trauma orientation, phase two is trauma processing, and phase three
            is trauma integration.
            Current research shows that symptoms are best targeted through approaches sensitive to the interplay of the
            body and the mind’s response to trauma.
            We utilize various body-based models that invite the client to access the trauma through a bottom-up, rather
            than top-down, approach.</p>

        <h3><font color="#01A9DB">Why Choose the Trauma Program at Genesis Sober?</font></h3>
        <p class="pfound3-3">Genesis Sober offers trauma-informed care utilizing treatment modalities such as EMDR,
            Sensorimotor Psychotherapy,
            and Somatic Experiencing within
            the context of a comprehensive psychological treatment that includes a range of group and individual therapies.
            When combined,
            these modalities can effectively treat both trauma and the psychological symptoms and conditions that often
            co-exist with trauma
            such as depression, anxiety, and relational problems.  We find that trauma treatment is most effective when
            clients are also engaging
            in adjunctive therapies such as DBT, ACT, Mentalization, Art Therapy, Music Therapy, and Neuro-feedback,
            as well as
            <font color="#01A9DB" style="cursor: pointer;">family therapy</font> and psychiatry when indicated.
            All of these approaches, and more, are available at Genesis Sober and can be combined in a tailored fashion to meet
            the unique needs of each client.</p>
