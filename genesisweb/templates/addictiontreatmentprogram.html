		<p class="para3">Residential addiction therapy services are an excellent option for overcoming chemical dependency.
            Pillars Recovery therapists routinely work with clients just like you to break the hold that addiction has.
            Have you wondered what this looks like? Here’s what you need to know about rehab today.</p>

		<h2>ADDICTION IS A TREATABLE DISEASE</h2>
            <div class="container-fluid">

		<P class="para3"><img src="{% static 'images/gym1.jpg' %}" alt="Photo 1" style="width: 400px; height:250px; float: right;">
         Addiction therapy services acknowledge that chemical dependency isn’t a moral failure. It has nothing to do
            with willpower. In contrast, it has everything to do with your brain. As such, addiction’s a chronic disease.
            It manifests with compulsive drug use. Even though you don’t want to keep using, you can’t stop.
            That’s where residential drug treatment can make a significant difference. Typical stays range from 30 to 90 days,
            depending on your care needs.</P>

		<h2>HOW THERAPISTS USE ADDICTION THERAPY SERVICES</h2>
		<p class="para3">Customization of a treatment protocol is a crucial aspect of success. Pillars Recovery addiction
            specialists understand that no two people are exactly alike. Your reasons for slipping into chemical
            dependencies differ from someone else’s. Substance abuse treatment must reflect this understanding.
            Your care experience starts with an assessment. Addiction specialists determine your current treatment needs.
            Most importantly, they help you think through your future needs, too. Therapies include:
•	Addiction detox program that allows you to withdraw safely from a drug or alcohol
•	Withdrawal management that minimizes pain and discomfort
•	Dual diagnosis treatment for co-occurring depression, anxiety, or other psychiatric disorders
•	Behavioral therapy in a one-on-one setting that encourages the establishment of functional coping skills
•	Holistic therapies such as acupuncture and massage therapy, which emphasize body and mind wellness
Throughout the process, you undergo a continuous assessment to gauge your progress. Doing so allows therapists to adjust
            the care protocol if needed. Most importantly, ongoing assessments provide you with a record of your personal
            growth. Building on these victories is essential for ongoing commitment to the program.</p>

			<h2>A ROBUST AFTERCARE COMPONENT SUPPORTS YOUR GOAL OF LIFELONG SOBRIETY</h2>

				<p class="para3">
					When talking about recovery, many people refer to detox and rehab. Few acknowledge that aftercare
                    is another crucial aspect of addiction therapy services. In contrast, Pillars Recovery specialists
                    focus intently on this part of your treatment, too. Aftercare is an integral part of relapse prevention.
                    It enables you to employ coping and life skills that you acquired during treatment. Most importantly,
                    it shows areas where you may need additional help. Some clients step down from residential care to
                    partial hospitalization. You return home but continue to receive full-time treatment at the rehab center.
                    Intensive outpatient care is another option. For clients who feel strong enough to return to a regular schedule,
                    it’s an excellent option. You schedule therapy around work, school, or family responsibilities.
                    Because you remain in treatment, you ease into your sober lifestyle with help.</p>
