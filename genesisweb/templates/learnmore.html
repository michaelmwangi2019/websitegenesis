			addiction can completely derail their lives and make it difficult to move forward.
			When you learn about Genesis Sober, you’ll also discover a facility that’s ready to
			guide young adults on a journey toward a happier and healthier life.</p>

		<h2>ABOUT GENESIS SOBER</h2>
		<P class="para3">Genesis Sober provides residential drug and alcohol recovery programs including detox and treatment,
			as well as outpatient aftercare programs. Our homes are located in comfortable and serene settings
			on the beautiful hills of Kiambu County. A key feature about Genesis Sober is that we offer services for both men and women. Our men’s and women's residential treatment center is located in Githunguri Springs.
			Our mission is to help everyone who desires to become free from the chains of addiction.<font color="#01A9DB"> As the owners and staff of Genesis Sober,

		<h2>OUR HISTORY</h2>
		<p class="para3">We created Genesis Sober to help people who want and need recovery. We believe that the cost of treatment should not be a barrier
			to accessing treatment. Furthermore, we were fed up with turning away people who desperately wanted to find help, but were unable to
			because they couldn’t afford it. We do not put a price on human life.
			An aspect about Genesis Sober that sets us apart from other facilities is our location. We created our treatment centers in luxurious Kiambu County
			highland homes <font color="#01A9DB">because we believe that comfort is essential to recovery.</font> Furthermore, these serene settings remove all distractions from
			recovery and offer our clients a “sun-kissed” Kirigiti lifestyle.
			Additionally, our compassionate and caring staff provides experienced, state-of-the-art, and proven treatment methods. Our desire is to see every one
			of our guests come to experience all of the promises that successful, long-term recovery has to offer.</p>
